        <h2> Introduction to Electromagnetism </h2>  
            <h3> 
                Magnetic Fields and Forces 
            </h3>
            <p> 
                Electromagnetism is one of the fundamental forces of nature that governs how electric charges and magnetic fields interact.
                At its core, it shows us that electricity and magnetism are not separate phenomena but are deeply connected. 
                A moving electric charge, such as an electron in motion, naturally creates a magnetic field around it. 
                This invisible field is what allows magnets to attract or repel each other without touching. 
                Magnetic fields also exert forces on other moving charges, which is why electric currents in wires can be pushed or pulled when placed near magnets. 
                These simple principles form the basis for countless technologies we rely on today, from electric motors and generators to communication systems. 
                By understanding how charges move and create fields, we begin to see how the invisible dance of electricity and magnetism powers much of our modern world.

            <h3>
                Magnetic Deflection — Simple Experiment
            </h3>
            <p>
                Idea: A wire carrying electric current will move when placed in a magnetic field. 
                This happens because moving charges (the current) feel a push from the magnetic field.
            </p>
            <p>
                What you need: A battery or low-voltage power supply, a piece of copper wire (about 5–10 cm), a magnet (bar magnet or horseshoe), two stands or clips to hold the wire, an ammeter (optional), and a small piece of paper to stick on the wire as a flag so movement is easier to see.
            </p>
            <p>
                Steps: Stretch the copper wire between two supports so it hangs freely in the middle. 
                Place the magnet under the middle part of the wire. 
                Connect the wire to the battery so current flows. 
                You will see the wire move sideways. 
                Now reverse the battery connections—the wire will move in the opposite direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why it happens: Electric current is made of moving charges like electrons. 
                When they pass through a magnetic field, they are pushed sideways. 
                This sideways push is called the magnetic force. 
                A stronger current or stronger magnet gives a bigger push.
           </p>
           <p>
                Everyday use: This simple effect is the working principle of electric motors. 
                Inside motors, many wires sit in magnetic fields and keep getting pushed, causing rotation. 
                That’s how fans, washing machines, and even electric cars run.
